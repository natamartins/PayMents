<h2 id="project">📁 Pratic test at Stone </h2>
<p>This is a practical test from Stone that I found free here on github and decided to do. The test is basically creating a dollar purchase converter and simulator!
With tax rate, IOF rate.
</p>
<p>It was a simple and fun little project to do, the point of this project is the logic that you will use to simulate the purchase of currency, adding rates and dollar value.</p>
<p>I used an API to get the current dollar value and always perform the simulation with data as close to reality as possible.</p>
<p>Using hooks to separate API functionality and maintain clean and accessible code, axios for API consumption.</p>

> Feel free to contribute to this project! Remember that practice makes perfect.
